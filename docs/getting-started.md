**Hype** comes with different *type* of installation `(with plugins) or (no plugins)`.
If you want to install the standard installation with `hype.color` supported, you can achieve it
by installing:


```console
$ pip install hypecli[standard]
```


If you want to **Hype** with `colors`, Use the installation code:

```console
$ pip install hypecli[color]
```

However if you want to add another cool <a href="https://hype.serum.studio/plugins/" class="internal-link">Hype Plugins</a>, use this installation code:

```console
$ pip install hypecli[<plugin_name>]
```
